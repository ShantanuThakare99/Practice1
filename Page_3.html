	<p style="color:black; font-size:30px;font-family: Times New Roman;" align="left">Vishrambaag Wada, a fine mansion situated at central Pune's Thorale Bajirao Road, was the luxurious residence of Peshwa Baji Rao II, the last Peshwa of Maratha confederacy, in early 19th century.</p>
	<p style="color:black; font-size:30px;font-family: Times New Roman;" align="left">The 20,000 sq.ft. wada presently houses a post office on its ground floor, a few other offices of the municipal corporation and a small museum of Maratha artifacts put together by noted Maratha historian, Babasaheb Purandare.</p>
	<p style="color:black; font-size:30px;font-family: Times New Roman;" align="left">The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.</p>

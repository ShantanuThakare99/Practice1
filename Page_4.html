	<p style="color:black; font-size:30px;font-family: Times New Roman;" align="left">n the year 1630 AD, Shivaji's Father Shahaji, established the Lal Mahal for his wife Jijabai and son. Shivaji stayed here for several years until he captured his first fort. The current Lal Mahal is a reconstruction of the original and located in the center of the Pune city.</p>
	<p style="color:black; font-size:30px;font-family: Times New Roman;" align="left">The original Lal Mahal was built with the idea of rejuvenating the recently razed city of Pune when Shahaji Raje entered the city along with Shivaji and his mother, Maasaheb Jijabai. Young Shivaji grew up here, and stayed in the Lal Mahal till he captured the Torna fort in 1645. Shivaji's marriage with his first wife, Saibai took place in Lal Mahal on 16 May 1640.</p>
